                <b>Introduction: </b>
                <br/>
                The purpose of this project is to create a simulation of a 
                file system to understand and explore the basic operations 
                involved in managing files and directories within a computer system.
                The simulation will provide users with an interactive user interface
                through which they can perform various file system operations. 
                The project aims to enhance the understanding of file systems 
                and the logic behind file management.
            </p>

                <b>Implementation Details:</b>
                <br/>
                The project will be implemented using React and Node.js.
                React for the frontend to make use of reusability of components, JSX, and Fast rendering.
                Node.js for backend to perform all the operations asynchronously and writting API using Express.js.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Testing and Validation:</b>
                <br/>
                The project will be thoroughly tested to ensure the correctness 
                and robustness of file system operations. 
                Unit testing and integration testing will be performed to validate individual functions 
                and the interactions between different components of the system. 
                User acceptance testing will be conducted to gather feedback and 
                make necessary improvements.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Conclusion:</b>
                <br/>
                By completing this project, the developer will gain valuable insights 
                into the workings of a file system, the intricacies of file management, 
                and the importance of data structures in organizing files and directories.
                As well as fetching the data, working of react components, different elements 
                such as sidebar, table, icons, images, form, radio, text field etc. 
                The simulation will serve as an educational tool to enhance knowledge 
                and understanding in the field of computer science and systems programming.
